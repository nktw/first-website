      <h1>Biography</h1>

      <div class="w3-justify w3-margin-left w3-margin-right">
        <p>Born in late colonial-era Hong Kong, Natalie was raised by UK-educated parents who instilled in her an unique set of Chinese-western cultural values.</p>

</div>
        <p>She studied in catholic schools throughout her childhood and teenage years, and moved to England to pursue higher education in 2011.</p>
        <p>Natalie enrolled in a bachelor's degree program in Media Practice at the University of Sussex in Brighton. After one semester of gaining experience on making videos and other media, she switched to a program in Human Geography, from which she believed she would gain a wider understanding of the world around her.</p>
        <p>During the first summer break from university, Natalie took the opportunity to volunteer for a dolphin research institute in Sardinia, Italy, as she rarely got the chance in Hong Kong to observe wildlife in their natural settings. The experience inspired her to go back to Hong Kong the following summer, and to work for a local environmental NGO while conducting a study in preparation for her thesis.</p>
        <p>In 2016, Natalie submitted her thesis and graduated with 1st Class Honor.</p>
        <p>She gained her first professional experience working as an intern for an ESG research company based in London. The two-month long internship introduced her into the new world of ESG investing and soon afterwards she was employed as a full-time Chinese analyst at RepRisk.</p>
        <p>In January 2016, Natalie moved to Berlin, Germany, and became one of the first employees of the Berlin office.</p>
        <p>Three years on, she has become a full-fledged analyst and learnt a great deal of socially and environmentally sustainable business conducts.</p>
        <p>When she is not in her office, Natalie can usually be found somewhere away from Berlin, experiencing and contemplating different aspects of life one spontaneous step at a time.</p>

      <h1>Arts of the Working Class: an art newspaper for all</h1>
     <div class="w3-justify w3-margin-left w3-margin-right">
      <p>It was a busy week for Berlin-based artist Paul Sochacki. Within five days, he helped to launch a new website and the newest issue of the Arts of the Working Class (AWC), an art newspaper launched in 2018 and partially distributed by the homeless in Berlin.<br><br>  <img src="/media/IMG_0517.jpg" style="width:20%;border:0;">
According to the latest estimation by the Federal Association for Homeless Assistance (BAG Wohnungslosenhilfe), there are 650,000 homeless people across Germany. It is believed that up to 10,000 of them are living on the streets of the German capital, while the number of Berliners considered to be without a permanent home is estimated at 50,000.<br><br> 
From the moment the idea of publishing an art newspaper sprung up, Sochacki has intended that the AWC would be distributed as a street newspaper. For him, the newspaper should serve the society as “a tool of solidarity that can basically work in any area where… [there is] high income inequality and people can pick it up and counter this inequality actively.” <br><br>
The AWC operates on an advertising-supported revenue model, which means that the publishing and running costs are covered by advertisements. For each 30,000 printed copies of an issue, a majority are given for free to homeless people in Berlin and London for distribution and they retain all proceeds generated from the street sales. The rest are sold at different distribution points in cities such as Brussels, Madrid and Vienna.<br><br> <img src="/media/IMG_0523.JPG" style="width:20%;border:0;">
Ecuador-born curator and co-founder of the AWC María Inés Plaza Lazo explained the title in an event in New York recently, “we are referring to a pre-industrial idea of labor… at the same time, we mock the idea that in our time there is a specific ideological frame that we can understand class struggle, since in our current governments there are no clear orientations and privatizing interests are moving the political sphere.”<br><br>
Each issue of the AWC contains a carefully-curated selection of photographs, artworks, poems, commentaries, and articles provided and written in different languages by artists and writers who also participate in the design of advertisements placed in the issue. The multilingualism of the newspaper, for the AWC editorial team, allows for difference in cultural perspectives. They want the newspaper to be accessible, collaborative, and “an offer for everyone”, as emphasized by Alina Kolar, one of three AWC publishers, at the website launch event in Berlin. <br><br> <img src="/media/IMG_0498.JPG" style="width:20%;border:0;">
Through these core elements, the AWC aims to redistribute power and wealth both within the art world and the society. Over the past 1.5 year, the newspaper has grown bigger in terms of content and outreach. For each new issue launched, the number of copies printed increases as they are being distributed by more street vendors and retail points. The schedule of Sochacki in 2020 is already packed with planned launch of issues in new cities. While the budget of publishing the AWC remains limited, it is for him and the rest of the AWC team a priority to find funding through advertising and a continuous struggle to maintain equilibrium that allows them to sustain their editorial office in a time of growth. <img src="/media/IMG_0479.JPG" style="width:20%;border:0;">
